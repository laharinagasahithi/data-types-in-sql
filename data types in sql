SQL Data Types
Each column in a database table is required to have a name and a data type.
An SQL developer must decide what type of data that will be stored inside each column when creating a table. 
The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, 
and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data.

CHAR(size)--	A FIXED length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters). 
The size parameter specifies the column length in characters - can be from 0 to 255. Default is 1
VARCHAR(size)	-- A VARIABLE length string (can contain letters, numbers, and special characters).
The size parameter specifies the maximum string length in characters - can be from 0 to 65535
DATE--	A date. Format: YYYY-MM-DD. The supported range is from '1000-01-01' to '9999-12-31'
INT(size)--	A medium integer. Signed range is from -2147483648 to 2147483647. Unsigned range is from 0 to 4294967295. 
The size parameter specifies the maximum display width (which is 255)
